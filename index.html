  <p class="text">Hi! I'm bystand. I'm a programmer/graphic designer based in the US. I do a wide range of work, including 3D design, logo design, discord bots, and websites (as you can see here). I'm always looking to learn how to do new things. I play lots of videogames such as Minecraft, Forza, Squadrons, NHL, and any that catch my fancy. I also play hockey and mountain bike.</p>
